A simple and secure OTP login system for WordPress/WooCommerce using MSG91 SMS API with full-screen and popup login options.

== Description ==

Happy Coders OTP Login is a simple, secure, and customizable OTP login plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce sites. It enables users to log in using their mobile number via one-time password (OTP) verification, using the MSG91 SMS API.

The plugin supports full-screen and popup login forms, integrates smoothly with WooCommerce, and helps improve user experience by replacing traditional email/password logins with secure phone-based authentication.

=== MSG91 Integration ===

This plugin uses the MSG91 SMS gateway (https://msg91.com) to send and verify OTPs. When a user attempts to log in or register, their phone number is securely sent to MSG91 to deliver the OTP via SMS. No other personal information is shared with MSG91.

You must have a valid MSG91 account and API key to use this plugin. Visit [MSG91's Terms of Service](https://msg91.com/legal/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://msg91.com/legal/privacy) for more details about how they handle data.

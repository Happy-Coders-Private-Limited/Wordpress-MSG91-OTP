OTP login for WordPress/WooCommerce using MSG91 API with full-screen and popup forms, automatic SMS alerts for orders and registrations â€” and now WhatsApp OTP support for login.

== Description ==

Happy Coders OTP Login is a simple, secure, and customizable OTP login plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce sites. It enables users to log in using their mobile number via one-time password (OTP) verification, using the MSG91 SMS API.

The plugin supports full-screen and popup login forms, integrates smoothly with WooCommerce, and improves user experience by replacing traditional email/password logins with secure phone-based authentication.

*NEW in version 1.7:*  
- Automatic SMS notifications for:
  - New user registrations
  - WooCommerce order placed
  - Order shipped
  - Order completed
  - Cart cronjob reminders
- *WhatsApp Send OTP for login*: users can now receive OTP via WhatsApp instead of (or along with) SMS.

This keeps your customers engaged and ensures they never miss important alerts.

=== MSG91 Integration ===

This plugin uses the MSG91 SMS and WhatsApp gateway (https://msg91.com) to send and verify OTPs, and also to send order-related notifications. You must have a valid MSG91 account and approved SMS/WhatsApp templates.

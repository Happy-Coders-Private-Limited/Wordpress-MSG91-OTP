OTP login for WordPress/WooCommerce using MSG91 API with full-screen and popup forms, plus automatic SMS alerts for orders and registrations.

== Description ==

Happy Coders OTP Login is a simple, secure, and customizable OTP login plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce sites. It enables users to log in using their mobile number via one-time password (OTP) verification, using the MSG91 SMS API.

The plugin supports full-screen and popup login forms, integrates smoothly with WooCommerce, and improves user experience by replacing traditional email/password logins with secure phone-based authentication.

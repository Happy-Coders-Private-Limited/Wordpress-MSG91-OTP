Secure OTP login for WordPress & WooCommerce using SMS and WhatsApp. Send automated order alerts with the MSG91 API. Be passwordless!

== Description ==

Happy Coders OTP Login is a simple, secure, and customizable OTP login plugin for WordPress and WooCommerce sites. It enables users to log in using their mobile number via one-time password (OTP) verification, using the MSG91 SMS API.

The plugin supports full-screen and popup login forms, integrates smoothly with WooCommerce, and improves user experience by replacing traditional email/password logins with secure phone-based authentication.
